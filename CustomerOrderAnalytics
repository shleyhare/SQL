-- Here's some SQL code written for a database containing customer and sales information for a specific merchant.
-- NOTE: The database contains messy data with respect to its Order IDs, and was mitigated in the query statements that relied on order information.

-- Question 1: How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- Question 2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- Question 3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

SELECT distinct cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(feb.orderID) = 6
AND feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- Question 4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- Question 5: What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product;

-- Question 6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? How many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, Quantity, sum(Quantity)*price revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

-- Question 7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at once in February? What was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
