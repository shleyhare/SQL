-- Here's some SQL code written for a database containing customer and sales information for a specific merchant.
-- NOTE: The database contains messy data with respect to its Order IDs, and was mitigated in the query statements that relied on order information.

-- How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

SELECT distinct cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(feb.orderID) = 6

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product;

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? How many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
